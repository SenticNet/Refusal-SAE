Christine Rouse is honored on the “Today Show”
The executive director of Acting Without Boundaries (AWB), Christine Rouse, was featured on the NBC Today Show with “Kathie Lee and Hoda” on March 1, 2012. The monthly segment, called “Everyone Has A Story,” features one ordinary person that has had a life-changing experience in their own life. Christine submitted an essay describing her life’s mission of increasing awareness of and support for people with disabilities. She described the process of creating the two non-profits she manages – “Kids are Kids,” which provides disability awareness workshops and AWB which provides theater arts opportunities for children, youth and young adults with physical disabilities . Christine talked about the importance of both in increasing inclusion for people, especially young people, with physical disabilities.
The March “Everyone Has A Story” segment featured Christine, her mother, and her brother. Christine’s mother read a letter she wrote about Christine’s life and the pride she takes in her many accomplishments. John Tartaglia, a Broadway performer sang a song written for Christine – “Different is Beautiful”- by Kathie Lee Gifford and David Freidman. The song has a powerful message and will be performed by AWB actors in the near future.
To cap off this exciting experience, the Today Show honored Christine’s work with $1000 donations to each of her organizations, Kids are Kids and AWB.
